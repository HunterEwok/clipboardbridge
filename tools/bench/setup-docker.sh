# Prepares a Linux host for the bench's member in a container (a device with
# os = "docker" in the inventory; docs/testbench.md). Run it from a checkout
# of the repository, as the user the bench connects as, who has sudo:
#
#   sh tools/bench/setup-docker.sh setup        # once: Docker, the docker group, the kill helper
#   sh tools/bench/setup-docker.sh up CBB       # a new container of the cbb binary CBB, its volume empty
#   sh tools/bench/setup-docker.sh down         # the container and its volume go (R1, R3)
#   sh tools/bench/setup-docker.sh teardown [--group]  # down, the image and the kill helper go;
#                                               # --group also takes the user out of the docker group
#
# setup installs Docker and its compose plugin from the distribution, puts
# the user in the docker group (sign in again for it to count) and installs
# cbbbench-kill-container with a sudoers rule that lets the user run exactly
# that without a password: F1 kills the container's process from the host,
# as a crash would, since docker kill counts as stopping it by hand and its
# restart policy would not start it again.
#
# up builds the image clipboardbridge:bench from CBB, a static cbb for this
# host's CPU (CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build ./cmd/cbb on a
# Pi), and runs it with packaging/docker/compose.home.yaml in ~/cbb-nas, so
# the container is named clipboardbridge and holds no group.
