# Runs a second member on a Linux host in a network namespace of its own, so
# that its traffic takes another way out than the host's own member: through
# a SOCKS5 proxy, such as a VPN client's local inbound (a device with
# os = "netns" in the inventory; docs/testbench.md). Run it as root, or as a
# user with sudo for it:
#
#   sh setup-netns.sh setup NAME SOCKS TUN2SOCKS  # once: the namespace, its way out, the units
#   sh setup-netns.sh up NAME CBB                 # the cbb binary CBB, its state empty, started (R1)
#   sh setup-netns.sh down NAME                   # the service stopped, its state gone (R3)
#   sh setup-netns.sh teardown NAME               # all of it gone again
#
# NAME is the device's name in the inventory (1 to 10 small letters and
# digits). SOCKS is the proxy's host:port as the host reaches it, such as
# 127.0.0.1:1080. Without UDP (SOCKS5 UDP ASSOCIATE) the member goes away
# from home with VLESS, which runs over TCP; WireGuard needs the UDP.
# TUN2SOCKS is a tun2socks binary (github.com/xjasonlyu/tun2socks) for this
# host's CPU.
#
# Everything lives in /opt/cbbbench-netns/NAME and two units,
# cbbbench-NAME-net (tun2socks) and cbbbench-NAME (the service). tun2socks
# runs in the host's namespace, where it reaches the proxy, and its TUN
# interface is moved into the member's namespace as the only way out, so
# nothing of the member reaches the host's own network. The namespace
# resolves names over TCP (use-vc), which any SOCKS proxy carries, and
# reaches IPv4 and IPv6 addresses alike, so a name's AAAA does not hang.
