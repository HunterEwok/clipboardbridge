# The environment can set CBB_TEAM (the team's 10-character ID; by default the
# Personal Team of the Apple ID signed in to Xcode), CBB_DEVICE (the phone's

# A free team may have three apps on a phone at a time, an extension counting
# as one, and the app group and shared keychain need the developer account, so
# the share extension (which finds the group only through them) and the widgets
# are left out unless --all. The build is Debug: messages show the error
