# Removes what install.sh installed on a Mac:
#
#   sudo sh /usr/local/share/clipboardbridge/uninstall.sh [--purge]
#
# It stops the service and the pasteboard agent of every user and removes
# their plists, the service's entry in the application firewall, the binary
# in /usr/local/bin (but not Homebrew's link there: brew uninstall removes
# that), the settings in /etc/clipboardbridge and the logs. The device's keys and group, in
# /Library/Application Support/clipboardbridge/state, stay for a reinstall
# unless --purge; the hidden _clipboardbridge user and group stay too, since
# files may still belong to them.
