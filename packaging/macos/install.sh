# Installs clipboardbridge on a Mac:
#
#   sudo sh install.sh [--in-place] [--port N] [--home-cgnat on|off] [--express | --no-firewall] path/to/cbb
#
# It creates the hidden _clipboardbridge user and group, installs the binary to
# /usr/local/bin, the service as a LaunchDaemon and the pasteboard agent as
# a LaunchAgent, adds the user who ran sudo to the group, asks whether the
# application firewall may let the service take connections, and starts or
# restarts both. --express (CBB_FIREWALL=express) allows it without asking
# and says so, --no-firewall (CBB_FIREWALL=no) does not and prints the
# commands that would; the answer is kept for later runs. With --in-place the agent and cbb in PATH run the binary
# where it is instead of a copy, for Homebrew, whose upgrades replace it
# there: the formula's caveats pass its opt path, and running this again
# after an upgrade restarts them on the new one. The service always runs a
# copy that only root can change, since it holds the group's keys and a
# Homebrew prefix belongs to the user. --port moves the member port from 8764
# to N, kept in /etc/clipboardbridge/clipboardbridge.env as on Linux until the
# next --port; --port 8764 goes back. --home-cgnat on (or CBB_HOME_CGNAT=1)
# counts 100.64.0.0/10, the carrier-grade NAT range, as the home network
# too, kept in the same file; --home-cgnat off goes back. uninstall.sh
# removes it all again.
