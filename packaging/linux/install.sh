# Installs clipboardbridge on a Linux machine with systemd:
#
#   sudo sh install.sh [--console] [--uinput] [--port N] [--home-cgnat on|off] [--auto-update on|off] [--express | --no-firewall] path/to/cbb
#
# The full member's archive and the lite member's
# (clipboardbridge-lite-linux-*) both carry this script, each with its own systemd unit beside it; cbb version
# tells the two apart. It installs the binary to /usr/local/bin, the service
# user, the systemd unit, for the full member the desktop autostart entry and user unit,
# and the tmux configuration, adds the user
# who ran sudo to the clipboardbridge group, and starts or restarts the service.
# --console also starts tmux after a login on the text console and the
# console helper for remote paste there. --uinput, for the
# full member, adds the uinput helper, which presses the keys of a remote
# paste on desktops without another way (GNOME and KDE without the portal's
# dialog), and loads the uinput module at boot. --port moves
# the member port from 8764 to N, kept in /etc/clipboardbridge/clipboardbridge.env
# until the next --port; --port 8764 goes back. It finds the firewall, lists
# the rules clipboardbridge needs (mDNS and its port from the home network)
# and asks whether to add them (firewall.sh); the answer is kept for later
# runs. --express (CBB_FIREWALL=express) adds them without asking and says
# what it added, --no-firewall (CBB_FIREWALL=no) adds none and prints the
# commands that would. While it manages them, every run keeps them current,
# so an old port stays closed. --home-cgnat on (or CBB_HOME_CGNAT=1) counts
# 100.64.0.0/10, the carrier-grade NAT range, as the home network too, for a
# home network that uses it: the service (CBB_HOME_CGNAT=1 in the same file), the systemd
# unit's address limit and the firewall rules; --home-cgnat off goes back.
# The full member only. --auto-update on|off (or CBB_AUTO_UPDATE) answers
# whether the full member updates itself once a day to a signed release,
# which it asks otherwise and keeps (packaging/update.sh, cbb update -auto).
# uninstall.sh removes it all again.
