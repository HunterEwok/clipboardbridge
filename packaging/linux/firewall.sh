# Opens and closes clipboardbridge's ports in the firewall:

#   sudo sh firewall.sh setup ask|express|no PORT   # install.sh runs it
#   sudo sh firewall.sh open PORT...                 # e.g. 8764
#   sudo sh firewall.sh close
#   sh firewall.sh kind                              # the firewall it finds
#   sh firewall.sh commands PORT...                  # what to run by hand
#   sudo sh firewall.sh hub-open PORT | hub-close     # cbb global hub runs them
#   sh firewall.sh hub-port | hub-commands PORT
#
# setup finds the firewall, lists each rule clipboardbridge needs and asks
# whether to add them, unless the answer is given (express: yes, no: no)
# or kept from before in /etc/clipboardbridge/firewall.answer. Yes adds them
# and keeps them current on every run; no prints the commands that add them,
# and clipboardbridge works while the firewall allows them.
#
# open allows mDNS and the TCP ports from the home network only, when ufw or
# firewalld is active, and remembers in /etc/clipboardbridge/firewall what it
# added. A bare nftables or iptables setup that drops input gets the
# commands to run, since rules added at run time do not survive a restart
# and each system keeps them its own way. close removes exactly what open
# added and nothing else, so open first closes, and a changed port leaves
# no old rule behind. install.sh and uninstall.sh run it.
