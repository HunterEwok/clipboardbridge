#   reproduce.sh CHECKOUT ELSEWHERE
# CHECKOUT, the repository, is built where it is. ELSEWHERE, a new or empty directory, gets
# its committed files without .git, as a tarball has them, and is built there with another
# time zone, umask and Go build cache. Both need what the app's build needs: the Android SDK
# with the NDK of cbb.ndk (apps/android/gradle.properties), Go and a JDK. CI's fdroid job
# runs it.
