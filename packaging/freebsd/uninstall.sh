# Removes what install.sh installed on FreeBSD, as root:
#
#   sh /usr/local/share/clipboardbridge/uninstall.sh [--purge]
#
# It stops the service and removes the binary, the rc.d script and its
# rc.conf line, the settings in /usr/local/etc/clipboardbridge and the
# firewall rules that install.sh added, and only those. The device's keys
# and group, in /var/db/clipboardbridge, stay for a reinstall unless
# --purge; the clipboardbridge user and group stay too, since files may
# still belong to them.
