# Installs or updates clipboardbridge on a Linux machine, an OpenWrt router
# (25.12 or later), a Mac or FreeBSD from a release (Windows has get.ps1):
#
#   curl -fsSL https://github.com/HunterEwok/clipboardbridge/releases/latest/download/get.sh | sudo sh
#
# Options go after "sh -s --": --express adds the firewall rules
# clipboardbridge needs without asking and says what it added, --no-firewall
# adds none and prints the commands that would, --port N moves the member
# port from 8764 to N, --home-cgnat on counts 100.64.0.0/10 as the home
# network too (a home network on the carrier-grade NAT range); on Linux, --lite installs the lite member for small devices instead of the full
# member, --console also starts tmux after a login on the text console, and
# --uinput adds the full member's uinput helper for remote paste on desktops
# without another way to press keys.
# --rootless, run without sudo (curl ... | sh -s -- --rootless), installs the
# full member, or with --lite the lite member, for the user who runs it, on
# Linux only (D-79).
# CBB_ATTESTATION=require refuses to install unless GitHub's build
# provenance attestation of the archive checks out (it needs gh, signed in);
# CBB_ATTESTATION=skip does not check it. CBB_VERSION=v1.2.3 picks a
# release instead of the latest; CBB_RELEASE_DIR, for tests, takes the files
# from a directory instead of downloading them.
#
# It downloads the archive for this system and architecture and SHA256SUMS
# from the release, checks the archive against it and, when gh is there and
# signed in, against the release workflow's attestation, and runs the archive's
# install.sh for this system, which finds the firewall, lists the rules
# clipboardbridge needs and asks whether to add them. On a Mac, Homebrew is
# the other way (docs/guide/install.md).
