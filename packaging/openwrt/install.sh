# Installs clipboardbridge, the full member or the lite one, on OpenWrt
# 25.12 or later, as root:
#
#   sh install.sh [--port N] [--auto-update on|off] path/to/cbb
#
# It installs the binary to /usr/bin, the user and group clipboardbridge,
# the procd init script, the settings in /etc/config/clipboardbridge (kept
# when they exist), the NTP hook that starts the service once the clock is
# set, the capability file and the list of files sysupgrade keeps, and
# starts or restarts the service. The keys live in
# /etc/clipboardbridge/state. The service works on the devices of the lan
# zone; list other zones in /etc/config/clipboardbridge. Its firewall rules
# come and go with the service (the init script); /etc/config/firewall is
# not touched. --auto-update on|off (or CBB_AUTO_UPDATE) answers whether the
# full member updates itself once a day to a signed release, from cron,
# which it asks otherwise and keeps (packaging/update.sh). uninstall.sh
# removes it all again.
