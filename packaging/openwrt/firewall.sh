#   sh firewall.sh hub-open PORT | hub-close  # cbb global hub runs them, as root
#   sh firewall.sh hub-port | hub-commands PORT
#
# The same commands as packaging/linux/firewall.sh for the hub. The rules
# are the service's own procd data, which fw4 reads (the init script): the
# member port and mDNS from the zones in /etc/config/clipboardbridge, and the
# hub's UDP port from wan while /etc/clipboardbridge/firewall.hub names it.
# hub-open writes that file and reloads the service, which publishes the
# rule; hub-close removes it. /etc/config/firewall is never touched.
