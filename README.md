# Clipboard Bridge

One clipboard for your phone and every computer at home: copy on one, paste on another.
Android, iPhone, Linux, Windows and Mac, on your own network, with no cloud and no
accounts. Its command is `cbb`.

> **Status: early development.** What works, and what has been tried on real devices, is
> in the [status table](#status) below.

## Get started

1. Install the app on your phone (Android: the APK in the
   [latest release](https://github.com/HunterEwok/clipboardbridge/releases/latest); iPhone:
   TestFlight, coming).
2. Install Clipboard Bridge on a computer:

   ```sh
   # Linux and Mac
   curl -fsSL https://github.com/HunterEwok/clipboardbridge/releases/latest/download/get.sh | sudo sh
   ```

   ```powershell
   # Windows 10 or 11, in an administrator PowerShell
   irm https://github.com/HunterEwok/clipboardbridge/releases/latest/download/get.ps1 | iex
   ```

3. Run `sudo cbb pair` on the computer and scan its QR code in the app.

No computer? A group of phones only works too: the phone is the hub while its app is open.
We recommend a computer that is often on, though, since it keeps sync away from home going at
any time ([two kinds of group](docs/guide/how-it-works.md#two-kinds-of-group)).

The [quick start](docs/guide/quickstart.md) walks through it step by step;
[Installing](docs/guide/install.md) has Homebrew, winget, Docker and the firewall.

## What it does

| From → to | What you do |
|---|---|
| Computer → computer | Copy on one, paste on another. Automatic. |
| Computer → Android | Copy on the computer, paste on the phone. Automatic. |
| Android → computer | Copy on the phone; sent by itself with the accessibility service, or with one tap. |
| Computer ↔ iPhone | One press of the Action button or a double tap on the back, then paste. |

iOS does not let apps read the clipboard in the background, so the iPhone needs one
gesture. Apple devices on one Apple Account already share a clipboard; Clipboard Bridge
connects them to everything else. On Linux it works with any desktop, and without one
through tmux and `cbb copy` and `cbb paste`.

## Principles

- **Your network only.** At home the devices talk to each other directly. Away from home
  they reach a computer of yours at home through the group's own encrypted tunnel
  ([how it works](docs/guide/how-it-works.md)). No cloud, no accounts, no telemetry.
- **Encrypted and paired.** All traffic uses TLS. A device joins your group once, by a QR
  code or a six-digit code, and talks only to the devices of the group.
- **The key stays on the phone.** In a group made on a phone, the phone holds the group's
  key in its security chip and admits every device.
- **Small.** One file per platform, no dependencies; runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero W.
- **Passwords stay put.** Items that password managers mark as secret are not synced
  automatically.

## Platforms

| Platform | Component |
|---|---|
| Linux: Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS and other distributions; x86-64, ARM64, ARMv7, ARMv6 | service, desktop connector, console helper, tray app |
| macOS | service, pasteboard agent, Mac app |
| Windows 10 (1809 or later) and 11; x86-64, ARM64 | service, clipboard agent, tray app |
| FreeBSD 15; x86-64, ARM64 | service |
| OpenWrt 25.12 and later; ARM64, ARMv7, MIPS, x86-64 | service, as an always-on member and the hub |
| Android | the app (an APK in every release) |
| iOS and iPadOS | the app, or a shortcut in the Shortcuts app |
| Apple Watch, Wear OS | a watch app, through the phone |
| Small Linux devices (routers, boards) | the lite member, also `cbb` ([lite/README.md](lite/README.md)) |

## Status

| Part | State | On real devices |
|---|---|---|
