// Package relay is the blind relay: a meeting point for a group that has no
// computer to be its hub, on a server the user runs (docs/design.md, "Blind
// relay"). It holds none of the group's keys. Each member registers with
// its member certificate and proves its WireGuard key, and gets a tunnel to
// the relay; inside the tunnels the relay joins two members' connections
// end to end, so the member protocol's TLS runs between the two members
// and the relay passes only its ciphertext. It is still a star: members
// reach only the relay, and the relay decides which two connections to
// join, only within one group. The wire format is in docs/protocol.md,
// section 14.
