// The member protocol runs over a TLS connection made with the group's
// member configuration. Each side sends frames of a 4-byte big-endian length
// and a JSON message. The first message of each side is a hello; then
// events follow, and a ping whenever the side has sent nothing for a while,
// so a silent connection is a dead one. A member that holds the group CA key
// sends a cert message with a renewed certificate to a peer whose
// certificate is due for renewal. The group's signed records travel in
// records messages to a peer whose hello names other records. The group's
// root sends an admin message with an admin CA to a member whose hello
// offers an admin key. In a group a computer created, an admin sends a
// phone_ca message with the iPhone CA and its key to an admin whose hello
// names another one. The group's hub sends a tunnel message to a member
// whose hello offers a tunnel key. An admin sends a command message with a
// signed command for the receiver, such as a sync mode, which answers with
// a result message. A hub sends a hubs message to another device that may
// be a hub, with its offer and its clients' keys. A device whose keys an
// attestation proves sends an evidence message with it after the hello.
// A member that keeps the group's server credentials sends them in a
// credentials message after the hello, and passes new ones on.
