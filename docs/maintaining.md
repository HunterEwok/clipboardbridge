# Maintaining

Settings and routines that live outside the repository files. Only the owner can change them;
a checked box means the setting is in place.

## Account

- [x] Two-factor authentication on the GitHub account, preferably with a passkey or a
  security key. This protects the repository more than any setting below.
- [ ] Optional: sign commits with an SSH key (`git config gpg.format ssh`) and add the key
  to GitHub as a signing key, so commits show as Verified.

## Repository settings

**Settings → General**

- [x] Features: Wiki and Projects off; Issues on.
- [x] Pull Requests: only **squash merging**; **Automatically delete head branches** on.
- [x] Releases: **release immutability** on.

**Settings → Moderation**

- Interaction limits are for a temporary cool-down only and are normally off.
- Conduct reports go to GitHub Support through **Report content**, as
  [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) says. A repository of a personal account has no
  option to send reports to the repository admins, and no email address is published.

**Settings → Advanced Security** (named Code security on some accounts)

- [x] **Private vulnerability reporting**. [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) relies on it.
- [x] **Dependency graph**, **Dependabot alerts** and **Dependabot security updates**.
- [x] **Secret scanning** and **Push protection**.
- [ ] **CodeQL** default setup off: the workflows `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` (advanced
  setup) scan GitHub Actions, Go, Rust and Kotlin on every pull request, and
  `codeql-swift.yml` scans the iPhone app and its kit when `apps/ios` changes, weekly, by
  hand and before each release. GitHub rejects their results while the default setup is on.
  The default setup cannot build the Kotlin app and builds only the kit, not the iPhone app.

**Settings → Actions → General**

- [x] Workflow permissions: **Read repository contents and packages permissions**.
- [x] **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests** off.
- [x] Fork pull request workflows: **Require approval for all external contributors**.

**Settings → Environments**

- [ ] Environment **release**, which holds every release secret (below, "Release secrets").

**Settings → Rules → Rulesets**

Branch ruleset **Production Branch Protection** (made from the GitHub template), active,
targeting the default branch:

- [x] Restrict deletions and block force pushes.
- [x] Require linear history.
- [x] Require a pull request before merging: 0 required approvals and **Require extra
  approval for unattributed changes** off, because a single maintainer cannot approve their
  own pull request; squash is the only merge method.
- [x] Require the status check `ci-ok` from the GitHub Actions app, with the branch up to date
  before merging. `ci-ok` is the last job of [the CI workflow](../.github/workflows/ci.yml)
  and passes only when every other job passed, so CI jobs can change without touching the
  ruleset.
- [x] Bypass list empty.

Tag ruleset **releases**, active, targeting `refs/tags/v*`:

- [x] Restrict updates and deletions, and block force pushes, so a release tag cannot be
  moved. Its bypass list stays empty.

Tag ruleset **release tags: create**, active, targeting `refs/tags/v*`:

- [ ] Restrict creations, with the role **Repository admin** in the bypass list (always
  allow): only the maintainer starts a release; an app or a token with write access cannot.
  It is a ruleset of its own so that the one above keeps an empty bypass list.

### Release secrets

The keys that sign release files are Actions secrets of the environment **release**
(**Settings → Environments → release**), never repository secrets: a repository secret
reaches any workflow on any branch, so anyone who may push a branch could read it. The
environment's **Deployment branches and tags** are *Selected branches and tags*: the tag
pattern `v*` and the branch `main`. The jobs that sign (`build`, `android` and
`openwrt-feed` in the release workflow, `homebrew` in the published workflow) name the
environment; a run by hand to check a key therefore starts from `main`. No required
reviewers: the release tag is the maintainer's decision already.

| Secret | What it is | Section |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CBB_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `CBB_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `CBB_ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`, `CBB_ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` | the Android release key | [Android signing key](#android-signing-key) |
| `CBB_WINDOWS_CERT_BASE64`, `CBB_WINDOWS_CERT_PASSWORD` | the Windows code signing certificate | [Signing for Windows](#signing-for-windows) |
| `CBB_OPENWRT_FEED_KEY` | the OpenWrt feed's key | [The OpenWrt feed](#the-openwrt-feed) |
| `CBB_HOMEBREW_TAP_KEY` | the tap's deploy key | [Homebrew](#homebrew) |

GitHub never shows a secret again, so each key is made on the maintainer's Mac and kept
there with an offline backup (an encrypted drive or a password manager) before it goes into
the environment; a key that exists only in GitHub is lost with it. To put one in:
`gh secret set NAME --env release < file`, or **Settings → Environments → release → Add
environment secret**.

## CI

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on every pull request and on
`main`:

- **check**: `gofmt`, `go mod tidy`, `go mod verify`, `go vet`, `staticcheck`,
  `govulncheck`, `actionlint` for the workflows,
  [the repository rules](../tools/repocheck/main.go) (English only, apart from the apps'
  translations; license headers in Go and Rust files; copied code with its license; the documentation's
  links, the old name, the command reference with every flag, the environment variables,
  the ports, the index of the documentation), and the design
  tokens (`go run ./tools/tokens -check`);
- **test**: `go test -race` on Linux x86-64, Linux ARM64, macOS and Windows, each with its
  own files' coverage;
- **go coverage**: Go's tests across packages with `-coverpkg`, the desktop clipboards and the
  e2e built with `-cover`;
- **coverage**: the coverage of every part that ran, in the run's summary, held to
  `tools/coverage/floor.json` ([testing](testing.md#coverage));
- **build**: a cgo-free build (`CGO_ENABLED=0`) for every Linux and Windows target, static
  on Linux, including ARMv6 for the Raspberry Pi Zero W; the macOS targets on macOS runners
  with cgo, for the pasteboard agent (see the Build section of [the design](design.md#build));
- **mdns with avahi**: the mDNS tests on real sockets, beside avahi-daemon, in a Debian
  container;
- **e2e**: the built binary as three members and an avahi resolver in Docker containers:
  pairing, sync, the holder of `clipboardbridge.local` and its handover, a wrong code
  ([tools/e2e/e2e.sh](../tools/e2e/e2e.sh));
- **desktop clipboards**: the Wayland data-control client under a headless sway and the X11
  client under Xvfb, against wl-clipboard and xclip;
- **packaging**: shellcheck for the scripts, `systemd-analyze verify` and `security` for the
  unit, and the desktop entry;
- **homebrew**: the formula written by `packaging/homebrew/formula.sh`, installed with
  Homebrew on macOS;
- **windows installer**: `install.ps1`, the service, the agent and `uninstall.ps1` on
  windows-latest;
- **phone kit**: ClipboardBridgeKit's tests on Linux and macOS, and its cross tests with the Go
  code (pairing over plain TCP on Linux; pairing and a member connection over TLS on macOS);
- **iPhone app**: the Xcode project from XcodeGen, built and tested on an iPhone simulator
  without signing;
- **Android app**: the Kotlin kit's tests and its cross tests with the Go code, and the app
  built, unit-tested and linted;
- **lite member (Rust)**: `cargo fmt`, `clippy` and the tests of `lite/`, the ARM64 and
  ARMv6 builds, and the e2e test of the lite member among Go members;
- **lite core on the ESP32**: the lite protocol core with its TLS built for the ESP32-C6 (RISC-V) and the
  ESP32-S3 (Xtensa), and the Nano ESP32 firmware (`lite/esp32`) built, its console and
  flash settings tested and its self-test run in Espressif's QEMU (both downloaded by hash);
- **ZX Spectrum Next**: the tests of the `.cbb` frame parser on the host, and the dot command
  built with z88dk (from its release source, checked by hash, cached);
- **ci-ok**: the summary that the ruleset requires.

Rules for workflows:

- Pin every action to a full commit SHA, with the version in a comment; Dependabot updates
  them.
- Set `permissions: contents: read` at the workflow level; grant more to a single job only
  when it needs it.
- Check out with `persist-credentials: false`.
- Pull request workflows get no secrets.
- Tools such as `staticcheck`, `govulncheck` and `actionlint` are pinned in `go.mod` and run
  with `go tool`. Go records them as indirect requirements, so `.github/dependabot.yml` allows
  them by name; otherwise Dependabot would never update them.

## Releases

- Before the tag, a pull request moves the changes under `## [Unreleased]` in
  `CHANGELOG.md` to a new `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section and updates the link
  references at the end of the file; the release notes are built from that section
  (`packaging/release-notes.sh`), which fails the release if it is missing.
  The same pull request sets `apps/android/version.properties` to `X.Y.Z` and its
  `versionCode` to `X*10000 + Y*100 + Z` (`tools/repocheck` asks for it), and adds the
  F-Droid changelog `apps/android/app/fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs/<versionCode>.txt`
  (500 characters at most); the release fails on a tag that differs from the file.
- Built by CI from a tag, never on a laptop: push a tag `vX.Y.Z` on main
  (`git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`), and
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds the archives, `SHA256SUMS` and the attestations and,
  once the iPhone app's CodeQL analysis passes on the tag (about 45 minutes),
  makes a draft release, with notes generated from the merged pull requests. The maintainer
  signs and publishes it on their Mac with `release-sign publish` ("Signed releases" below).
  A tag `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` makes a pre-release, which `releases/latest` and so `get.sh` skip;
  it needs no pull request first: its notes take CHANGELOG's *Unreleased*, and the Android apps
  take the tag's version.
- The archives are `clipboardbridge-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz` without the version, so that
  `releases/latest/download/` has fixed names for `get.sh`; each holds `clipboardbridge/` with the
  binary, `LICENSE`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES` (the licenses of the Go modules, the copied code
  and Go itself, written by `packaging/archive.sh`) and `packaging/`. The
  `clipboardbridge-lite-linux-*` archives hold `clipboardbridge-lite/` in the same way (`lite/packaging/archive.sh`), with the crates'
  licenses (`lite/packaging/notices.sh`), the same Linux installer and the lite member's unit.
- The iPhone shortcuts are the one exception: iOS imports only shortcuts signed with an
  Apple ID, which needs a Mac. When `go run ./tools/shortcut` changes `clipboardbridge.plist` or
  `clipboardbridge-add.plist`, sign each changed one (here `NAME`) on a Mac:
  `plutil -convert binary1 -o /tmp/NAME-unsigned.shortcut internal/phone/shortcut/NAME.plist`
  (`shortcuts sign` reads only the binary form) and
  `shortcuts sign --mode anyone --input /tmp/NAME-unsigned.shortcut --output internal/phone/shortcut/NAME.shortcut`,
  check the result by importing it on an iPhone, and commit the signed file.
- Published with `SHA256SUMS` and a build provenance attestation
  (`actions/attest-build-provenance`), which users can check with `gh attestation verify`.
- After the draft, the `docker` job builds the image of `packaging/docker` from the
  release's own Linux archives for amd64, arm64 and armv7, pushes it to
  `ghcr.io/hunterewok/clipboardbridge` as `X.Y.Z` (and `latest`, but not for a pre-release),
  attests it in the registry and adds its digest to the release notes. The first push makes
  the package private: once, in the package's settings on GitHub, make it public.

## Signed releases

The release files of docs/protocol.md, section 16, are made with `tools/release-sign` on
the maintainer's Mac; the keys never reach CI. The roots were made on 2026-10-28
(`internal/release/roots`, with their attestations); releases from 0.6 on are signed.

- **The root keys**, once: one on each of two YubiKeys, kept apart, with a PIN and touch
  for every signature. The YubiKeys may be in daily use for other things: the root goes
  into a free retired PIV slot (82 when `ykman piv keys info 82` finds no key), and nothing
  else on the key is reset or changed. `ykman piv keys generate --algorithm ECCP256
  --pin-policy ALWAYS --touch-policy ALWAYS 82 root-N.pem`, then `ykman piv certificates
  generate --subject "CN=Clipboard Bridge release signing root N (2026)" 82 root-N.pem` so
  the key can be read from the slot, and `ykman piv keys attest 82` with the `f9`
  certificate as proof that the key was made on the YubiKey.
  Their public keys go into `packaging/get.sh` (`release_roots`), `packaging/windows/get.ps1`
  (`$releaseRoots`) and the programs (`internal/release.Roots`, the lite member's
  `update::ROOTS` in `lite/src/update.rs`, and the phone kits' `Releases.roots`, which
  also turn on the Android app's own update).
- **The release key**, in the Mac's Secure Enclave, asking for Touch ID at each signature:
  `swift tools/release-sign/se.swift create ~/.config/cbb-release/release.se`. A root
  certifies it in `keys.json`, which lives 90 days.
- **The branch `channel`** holds the current `keys.json` and `stable.json`
  (docs/protocol.md, section 16, "Where the files are"), since a published release takes no
  new files. `release-sign publish` makes it with the first signed release, and only
  `release-sign` and the `channel` workflow write to it.
- **The channel key**, once, on cbb.tools beside the status key, readable only by root:
  `openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out /etc/cbb-channel/channel-key.pem`
  and its public key `openssl ec -in channel-key.pem -pubout -out channel.pem`, copied to the
  Mac. The first `release-sign publish` certifies it with `-channel cbb.tools=channel.pem`;
  later ones keep it. A weekly systemd timer on cbb.tools
  (`site/deploy/cbb-channel.service` and `.timer`, as the user `cbb-channel`, which gets the
  root-only key as a credential for the run) runs `release-sign extend -key
  file:channel-key.pem -out /srv/cbb.tools/channel`, which reads the
  branch, checks it, signs `stable.json` again for 30 days with the same release and a
  higher number, and serves it with `keys.json` at `https://cbb.tools/channel/` (build it
  with `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build ./tools/release-sign`). The daily `channel`
  workflow (`.github/workflows/channel.yml`) takes it into the branch with `release-sign
  take`, which refuses one that does not check out, names another release or is not newer.
  GitHub holds no key and cbb.tools no GitHub token.
- **Each release**: once the release workflow has made the draft (its `docker` job adds the
  image's digest to the notes), `release-sign publish -version X.Y.Z [-min-from X.Y.Z]` on
  the Mac, with `gh` signed in. It downloads the draft's files, checks each one's build
  attestation against the tag (`gh attestation verify --source-ref refs/tags/vX.Y.Z`), keeps
  the branch's `keys.json` when it is valid for 45 more days and certifies the release key
  and the keys asked for (otherwise a root signs a new one, numbered above it, with the same
  keys: the YubiKey's PIN and a touch), signs `release.json` and `stable.json` (numbered
  above the branch's) with the release key (Touch ID for each), checks all of it under the
  pinned roots as a device would, uploads `release.json` to the draft and, after a yes,
  publishes it and commits `keys.json` and `stable.json` to the branch. `-no-publish` stops
  before publishing, `-docker none` signs a release without the image; a pre-release
  changes no `stable.json`. `published.yml` then checks what GitHub serves and updates the
  Homebrew tap. The steps by hand: `release-sign manifest`, `sign`, `channel`, `keys` and
  `verify` (the comment in `tools/release-sign/main.go`).
- **Reminders**: the `channel` workflow opens the issue "Release channel: renewal due" when
  the branch's `keys.json` expires within 21 days (run `release-sign renew -new-keys` on the
  Mac with a YubiKey) or its `stable.json` within 10, which means cbb.tools stopped renewing
  it (check its timer, or run `release-sign renew`, which signs it with the release key).
- A lost or stolen Mac: a root signs a `keys.json` with a new release key and without the
  old one. A lost YubiKey: the other root signs, and the next release ships a new second root.
  A stolen channel key: a new one on cbb.tools, and `release-sign renew -drop cbb.tools
  -channel cbb.tools-2=channel.pem` (`-drop NAME` drops any key by its name in `keys.json`).
- **The status key** of the revocation mirror, on cbb.tools in a file readable only by the
  mirror's user (it signs nothing but `attest-status.json`, so a stolen one can at most keep
  a revoked phone proven until it is replaced): `openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey
  -noout -out status-key.pem`. `keys.json` certifies it with `-status mirror=status.pem`. A
  daily timer runs `attest-status -key status-key.pem -out /srv/cbb.tools/attest` and copies
  `keys.json` beside it from `/srv/cbb.tools/channel`. When it stops on a list that drops a serial number, check Google's
  list and run it once with `-allow-drop`; a stolen status key is dropped from the next
  `keys.json` like a release key.
- **The TPM makers' certificates** in `internal/attest/tpmroots/roots.pem`, which decide
  whose TPMs prove their keys (docs/protocol.md, section 17, "TPM evidence"): before a
  release, download Microsoft's TrustedTpm.cab (its README says where), check its
  Authenticode signature, extract the root and intermediate certificates as PEM, review the
  diff (a maker added or gone) and note the date in the README.
- `release-sign drill -version X.Y.Z DIR ROOTS.pem` signs DIR with throwaway keys in files,
  as CI does to test the installers, and for drills of the steps above.

## Homebrew

The tap is the repository
[HunterEwok/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/HunterEwok/homebrew-tap),
the one tap for all of the owner's formulae; Clipboard Bridge's is `Formula/clipboardbridge.rb`, and users install with
`brew install hunterewok/tap/clipboardbridge`. After each release (not a
pre-release) is published, `.github/workflows/published.yml` checks its signed files and writes the formula with
`packaging/homebrew/formula.sh` from the release's `SHA256SUMS` and pushes it to the tap's
`main`. The formula installs the release archives as they are, so it needs no Apple signing,
and CI's `homebrew` job installs one with it on macOS on every pull request.

Setting it up, once:

- [x] Create the public repository `HunterEwok/homebrew-tap`, empty (no README,
  license or `.gitignore`).
- [x] Make a key for it, on any computer:
  `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -C homebrew-tap -f homebrew-tap`.
- [x] In the tap, **Settings → Deploy keys → Add deploy key**: the contents of
  `homebrew-tap.pub`, with **Allow write access**. It can write to the tap and nothing else.
- [ ] In the environment **release** ("Release secrets" above), the secret
  `CBB_HOMEBREW_TAP_KEY`: the contents of `homebrew-tap`, the private key. Then delete both
  files: a lost tap key is replaced by making a new one the same way.

To check the key without a release, run the published workflow from `main` (**Actions →
published → Run workflow**): its `homebrew` job pushes to the tap with `--dry-run`, which
fails unless the key may write there.

Without the secret the release still succeeds and warns that the tap kept its formula. To
fill the tap for a release made before, run `formula.sh` with that tag and its
`SHA256SUMS` and commit the output to the tap by hand.

## winget

The package `HunterEwok.clipboardbridge` installs the release's zip for Windows as winget's
portable command `cbb`; `cbb install` then runs the installer from the same zip. For each
release (not a pre-release) the `release` job of `.github/workflows/release.yml` writes its
three manifest files with `packaging/winget/manifest.sh` from the release's `SHA256SUMS` and
publishes them with the release as `winget-manifest.zip` (nothing can be attached to a
release once published, as releases are immutable); CI's `packaging` job checks the script on every pull
request. winget takes a package only by a pull request to
[microsoft/winget-pkgs](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs), which its reviewers merge:

- [ ] For each release, on a Windows PC: unpack `winget-manifest.zip`, check it with
  `winget validate --manifest <folder>` and `winget install --manifest <folder>`, then submit
  it with `wingetcreate submit <folder>` (it asks for a GitHub token and opens the pull
  request under `manifests/h/HunterEwok/clipboardbridge/<version>`).

## The OpenWrt feed

The release workflow's `openwrt-feed` job wraps each Linux archive in an apk package for
OpenWrt 25.12 and later (`packaging/openwrt/feed.sh`, run in the pinned `alpine:3.23`
image, whose apk has mkpkg and mkndx, which OpenWrt's leaves out), one feed per Go architecture, and signs each index
with the feed's ECDSA P-256 key. It publishes them with the release as
`openwrt-feed.tar.gz`: `<arch>/packages.adb`, `<arch>/clipboardbridge-<version>.apk` and
the public key `clipboardbridge.pem`. CI's `openwrt` job builds a feed with a test key on
every pull request and installs and removes the package from it. Setting it up, once:

- [ ] Make the key on any computer: `openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out
  feed.pem`.
- [ ] In the environment **release**: `CBB_OPENWRT_FEED_KEY`, the contents of
  `feed.pem`. Keep a copy offline; a new key means every router fetches the new public key.

For each release, unpack `openwrt-feed.tar.gz` into the site's `openwrt/` directory on
cbb.tools (routers read `https://cbb.tools/openwrt/<arch>/packages.adb`). Without the
secret the release still succeeds and warns that there is no feed.

## Signing for Windows

The release workflow signs `cbb.exe` and `cbbw.exe` with Authenticode (`osslsigncode`, SHA-256,
a timestamp from DigiCert) when the secrets hold a code signing certificate; without it they
stay unsigned and SmartScreen warns on the first start. Setting it up, once:

- [ ] Buy a code signing certificate whose key can be exported as a PKCS#12 file (an OV
  certificate; an EV one lives on a hardware token and needs a signing service instead).
- [ ] In the environment **release**: `CBB_WINDOWS_CERT_BASE64`, the `.pfx` file in
  base64 (`base64 -w0 cert.pfx`), and `CBB_WINDOWS_CERT_PASSWORD`, its password.

To check it without a release, run the release workflow from `main`: its Windows builds
sign the programs.

### SignPath Foundation

Microsoft's Artifact Signing does not take individuals outside the USA and Canada, so the
plan for a certificate without buying one is the [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org),
which signs open-source projects for free with its own certificate:

- [ ] Apply on signpath.org with this repository (AGPL-3.0, releases built by GitHub Actions
  from tags, the code-signing policy page they ask for).
- [ ] Once accepted, they give an organization id, a project slug and a signing policy; put
  `SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN` in the Actions secrets and the ids in Actions variables.
- [ ] The release workflow then uploads the unsigned `cbb.exe` and `cbbw.exe` as an
  artifact, submits it with SignPath's GitHub action, and archives the signed programs it
  gets back, in place of the `osslsigncode` step (which stays for a bought certificate).

`cbb update` on Windows needs nothing more: once the installed programs carry a signature,
it installs only programs with the same signer.

## Updates of the Mac app (Sparkle)

The Mac app is not yet in the releases; once the Apple developer account exists and the app
is signed with a Developer ID and notarized, it updates with [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org):

- [ ] Sparkle's own Ed25519 key, made with Sparkle's `generate_keys` on the maintainer's Mac
  and kept in its keychain; the public key goes into the app's `Info.plist`
  (`SUPublicEDKey`) in `apps/macos/project.yml`.
- [ ] The release workflow builds, signs and notarizes `ClipboardBridge-X.Y.Z.zip`;
  `release-sign manifest` lists it like the other files.
- [ ] `appcast.xml` beside `stable.json`, with each version's EdDSA signature
  (`sign_update`), made when `stable.json` is signed, so both name the same release.
- [ ] The app checks the appcast once a day (`SUFeedURL` on GitHub's latest release, the
  mirror second), and Settings gets "Check for updates" and "Update automatically".

## Android signing key

The release workflow builds `clipboardbridge-X.Y.Z.apk` and `clipboardbridge-fdroid-X.Y.Z.apk`
from the tag (version code `X*10000 + Y*100 + Z`, from `apps/android/version.properties`)
and signs them with the project's release key, which lives in the environment **release**
("Release secrets" above) and, with a backup, on the maintainer's Mac. Android installs an update only when it is signed with the same
key, so the key is made once and kept, with a backup, for good:

```sh
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore clipboardbridge-release.jks -alias clipboardbridge \
  -keyalg EC -groupname secp256r1 -validity 36500 -dname "CN=clipboardbridge"
base64 -i clipboardbridge-release.jks | pbcopy   # macOS; Linux: base64 -w0 clipboardbridge-release.jks
```

The secrets: `CBB_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` (the keystore, in base64),
`CBB_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `CBB_ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` (`clipboardbridge`) and
`CBB_ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` (the same as the keystore's for a PKCS12 keystore). Without them
the release has no APK. F-Droid publishes our signed `clipboardbridge-fdroid-X.Y.Z.apk` once
its own build of the tag matches it (below).

To check the key without a release, run the release workflow by hand from `main` (Actions,
"release", "Run workflow"): it builds everything, checks the APK's signature and keeps the
files as the run's artifacts, and publishes nothing.

## F-Droid

The app's F-Droid build ([apps.md](apps.md#f-droid)) is published by F-Droid, from its
recipe in [fdroiddata](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata); `packaging/fdroid` holds the
recipe we submit. Once, for the first release with the fdroid flavor:

- [ ] Fill in the recipe: `AllowedAPKSigningKeys`, the SHA-256 of the release key's
  certificate (`apksigner verify --print-certs clipboardbridge-fdroid-X.Y.Z.apk`), and
  `ndk`, the `cbb.ndk` of the tag.
- [ ] Check that F-Droid's build reproduces ours: `fdroid build -v -l
  io.github.hunterewok.clipboardbridge` in a clone of fdroiddata with the recipe, on
  F-Droid's buildserver image (`fdroid build` compares with `Binaries`).
- [ ] Open the merge request to fdroiddata (GitLab account), with the recipe as
  `metadata/io.github.hunterewok.clipboardbridge.yml`, and answer the reviewers.

After that, each release's tag is picked up by F-Droid's update check
(`UpdateCheckData` reads `apps/android/version.properties`), usually within days. When a
release's F-Droid build does not reproduce, F-Droid does not publish it; CI's `fdroid` job
catches most causes before the tag.
