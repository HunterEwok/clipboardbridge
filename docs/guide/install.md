# Installing

Clipboard Bridge runs as a small background service on each computer. Its command is `cbb`.
Every way below installs the same program; pick the one you like.

## Linux

Any Linux with systemd (x86-64, ARM64, ARMv7, ARMv6): a laptop, a desktop, a Raspberry Pi,
a server, a Steam Deck.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/HunterEwok/clipboardbridge/releases/latest/download/get.sh | sudo sh
```

Then log out and in again once, so your user may use `cbb` without `sudo`. A machine
without a desktop gets copy and paste inside tmux with `--console`
(`... | sudo sh -s -- --console`).

Remote paste on GNOME and KDE asks once, in a dialog on the computer, before an admin's
first paste may press the keys. To skip the dialog, add `--uinput` (`... | sudo sh -s -- --uinput`): a small helper then
presses the paste keys (Shift+Insert and Enter) for whoever uses the screen, never on a
login or lock screen.

Small devices that should only sync, such as a router or a Raspberry Pi Zero, can take the
lighter [lite member](../../lite/README.md) instead: `... | sudo sh -s -- --lite`.

### Without sudo (rootless)

On a Linux computer where you cannot or do not want to use `sudo`, install it for your own
user, without `sudo`:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/HunterEwok/clipboardbridge/releases/latest/download/get.sh | sh -s -- --rootless
```

It runs as your own background service while you are logged in, and syncs as any member.
Use it only when the normal install is not possible: every program you run could copy its
keys, so it can never be the group's root, an admin or the hub
([how it works](how-it-works.md#rootless-members)), and it has no firewall rules, no TPM and
no `--console` or `--uinput`. To keep it running after you log out, an administrator runs
`sudo loginctl enable-linger YOUR-USER` once. To remove it:
`sh ~/.local/share/clipboardbridge/uninstall.sh`.

### SteamOS (Steam Deck)

Switch to Desktop Mode, open Konsole, give the `deck` user a password once if it has none
(`passwd`), and run the same command. SteamOS replaces its system files with each update, so
the installer puts Clipboard Bridge in `/opt/clipboardbridge` instead of `/usr/local`, and
tells SteamOS which of its files in `/etc` to keep (`/etc/atomic-update.conf.d/clipboardbridge.conf`).
It stays installed and in its group across SteamOS updates.

- `cbb` is in the path of a new Konsole after you log out and in again. `sudo` does not
  look there, so commands that need it take the whole path:
  `sudo /opt/clipboardbridge/bin/cbb pair`.
- In Desktop Mode the clipboard syncs as on any KDE Plasma desktop.
- In Game Mode there is no desktop clipboard, so nothing syncs there; the service keeps
  running and catches up in Desktop Mode.
- To remove it: `sudo sh /opt/clipboardbridge/share/uninstall.sh`.

## Mac

Apple silicon or Intel, in Terminal, the same command as on Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/HunterEwok/clipboardbridge/releases/latest/download/get.sh | sudo sh
```

Or with Homebrew, which also updates it. Run the second line again after each
`brew upgrade`:

```sh
brew install hunterewok/tap/clipboardbridge
sudo sh "$(brew --prefix)/opt/clipboardbridge/share/clipboardbridge/packaging/macos/install.sh" --in-place "$(brew --prefix)/opt/clipboardbridge/bin/cbb"
```

## Windows

Windows 10 (1809 or later) or 11, x86-64 or ARM64, in a PowerShell opened with "Run as
administrator":

```powershell
irm https://github.com/HunterEwok/clipboardbridge/releases/latest/download/get.ps1 | iex
```

It lets the user signed in at the screen use `cbb` (in a new terminal) and starts the
clipboard agent for them. Commands that change the group run in a terminal opened as
administrator, where Linux and macOS use `sudo`.

With winget, once the package is in winget's repository:

```powershell
winget install HunterEwok.clipboardbridge
cbb install           # in the administrator terminal; again after each winget upgrade
```

## OpenWrt

A router with OpenWrt 25.12 or later and room for a 25 MB program (128 MB of flash or
more, or eMMC; 256 MB of RAM), as root over SSH:

```sh
uclient-fetch -qO - https://github.com/HunterEwok/clipboardbridge/releases/latest/download/get.sh | sh
```

It installs `cbb` as a service that works only on the `lan` zone and never answers on
`wan`. The keys live in `/etc/clipboardbridge`, which sysupgrade keeps; after an attended
sysupgrade (ASU, owut), run the command again. Another zone, such as an IoT network, the
firewall and the checks are in [routers and FreeBSD](../admin/routers.md#openwrt).

Or from our package feed, which `apk upgrade` then keeps current. The feed's architecture
follows the router's CPU (`grep DISTRIB_ARCH /etc/openwrt_release`): `arm64` for
`aarch64_*`, `armv7` for `arm_cortex-a*` with `neon` or `vfp` in the name, `mipsle` for
`mipsel_*`, `mips` for `mips_*`, `amd64` for `x86_64`. Put yours in place of `arm64` in
the second line:

```sh
uclient-fetch -qO /etc/apk/keys/clipboardbridge.pem https://cbb.tools/openwrt/clipboardbridge.pem
echo https://cbb.tools/openwrt/arm64/packages.adb >>/etc/apk/repositories.d/customfeeds.list
apk update && apk add clipboardbridge
```

`apk del clipboardbridge` removes it and keeps the keys in `/etc/clipboardbridge`.

## FreeBSD

FreeBSD 15, amd64 or arm64, as root (with `sudo` or `doas`):

```sh
fetch -qo - https://github.com/HunterEwok/clipboardbridge/releases/latest/download/get.sh | sh
```

It installs `cbb`, an rc.d script that runs the service through daemon(8), and adds the
line `clipboardbridge_enable="YES"` to rc.conf. The keys live in `/var/db/clipboardbridge`.

On OPNsense the same installer also adds a plugin hook: the service shows under System >
Diagnostics > Services, and its firewall rules (in pf's anchor `clipboardbridge`) follow
every filter reload. Turn off the mDNS repeater (Services > mDNS Repeater) while it runs:
both need UDP port 5353, and the service answers mDNS on each home interface itself.
pfSense is not supported: the installer runs there too, but it prints the firewall rules
for Firewall > Rules instead of adding them, and an update of pfSense may remove Clipboard
Bridge.

On a FreeBSD desktop (X11, or Wayland with the data control protocol, as in KDE, sway and
Hyprland), the session starts `cbb agent` from XDG autostart and the clipboard joins the
group; log in again after the install. Remote paste types through XTEST on X11 and the
virtual keyboard on wlroots desktops; GNOME takes no remote paste on FreeBSD, since without
logind nothing tells whether its screen is locked.

## Docker

For a NAS or a home server that is always on
([image's README](../../packaging/docker/README.md); published with each release from 0.5).
It joins as an ordinary member: make the group on the phone or a computer you hold.

```sh
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HunterEwok/clipboardbridge/main/packaging/docker/compose.home.yaml
docker compose -f compose.home.yaml up -d
docker compose -f compose.home.yaml exec clipboardbridge cbb pair
```

## The firewall

Clipboard Bridge needs one TCP port, 8764, and mDNS (UDP 5353), both from the home network
only. The installer finds the firewall (ufw, firewalld, nftables or iptables on Linux, pf
or ipfw on FreeBSD, the Mac's application firewall, Windows Firewall), lists each rule, and
asks
`Add these rules now? [y/N]`:

- **Yes**: it adds them, keeps them current on every update and removes them when you
  uninstall. It never touches other rules.
- **No** (the default, and when there is no terminal to ask in): it adds nothing and prints
  the exact commands, for you to run yourself.
- `--express` (`-Express` on Windows) adds them without asking; `--no-firewall` answers No.

nftables and iptables always get the commands only, since rules added at run time do not
survive a restart there. On FreeBSD, pf gets the rules in an anchor of their own, which
pf reads through three marked lines the installer adds at the end of `/etc/pf.conf` and
removes again; ipfw gets them in rule set 17, added again at each start. If you turn a
firewall on later, run the installer again.

**Another port**, if 8764 is taken: `... | sudo sh -s -- --port 9000` (on Windows,
`$env:CBB_PORT = "9000"` before the installer). The phone app learns the port from the QR
code; the iPhone shortcut works only with 8764.

All installer options are in the [command reference](../reference/cli.md#installers).

## Updating

Releases are signed from 0.6 on. To move to 0.6 from an earlier version, run the install
command again; from then on `cbb update` does it.

`sudo cbb update` (on Windows `cbb update` in a terminal opened as administrator) installs
the newest release on a computer or a lite member installed with `get.sh`, `get.ps1` or a
release archive; `cbb update -check` only says whether there is one. Your settings stay.
It installs only a release the project signed, and never an older one. If the new version
does not start within a minute, the previous one comes back by itself. How it checks the
signatures is in the [protocol](../protocol.md), section 16.

The installers ask once whether to update automatically (`--auto-update on|off`, or
`-AutoUpdate on|off` and `$env:CBB_AUTO_UPDATE` on Windows, answer it beforehand);
`sudo cbb update -auto on|off` changes it later. On, a timer checks once a day at a time of
its own: a systemd timer on Linux, a launchd job on a Mac, a scheduled task as SYSTEM on
Windows, cron on OpenWrt and FreeBSD. Each check downloads the same small files from GitHub
(or from `dl.cbb.tools` when GitHub does not answer), so GitHub learns this device's address
and that it uses Clipboard Bridge, as with any download; it sends nothing about the group.
`sudo cbb update -mirror https://...` takes updates from another mirror instead, which
needs no trust, since the signatures are checked. The timer's log is `update.log` in
`/var/lib/clipboardbridge-update` (Linux), `/etc/clipboardbridge-update` (OpenWrt),
`/var/db/clipboardbridge-update` (FreeBSD), `/Library/Application Support/clipboardbridge-update`
(Mac) or `C:\Program Files\clipboardbridge-update` (Windows).

The devices of a group tell each other of the newest signed release any of them has seen, so
one device's check is enough for `cbb status` and the tray app on the others to say that a
newer release is out ("Update to X" in the tray app runs `cbb update` as the administrator).
Each device still checks the signatures itself and downloads its own archive.

Running the same install command again also updates. With Homebrew or winget, upgrade
there and run the second line again; `cbb update` says so. Docker and the OpenWrt package
update through `docker compose pull` and `apk upgrade`.

## Checking a download

The one-line installers check the download against the release's `SHA256SUMS`. Every
release file also has a build provenance attestation that ties it to this repository and
the build that made it; with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/):

```sh
gh attestation verify clipboardbridge-linux-amd64.tar.gz --repo HunterEwok/clipboardbridge
```

`get.sh` checks it by itself when `gh` is installed and signed in for root
(`sudo gh auth login`); `CBB_ATTESTATION=require` refuses to install without it.

Releases are also signed with the project's own keys, which never touch CI (the root keys
sit on offline hardware keys, the release key in the maintainer's Secure Enclave):
`keys.json` names the release keys under the project's root keys, `release.json` lists every
file of the release with its hash, and `stable.json` says which release is current. Once the
root keys are built into the installers, `get.sh` (with `openssl`) and `get.ps1` check these
before they install, and refuse a release that is not signed; until then they check
`SHA256SUMS` and the attestation only. `CBB_VERIFY=skip` installs without the check.

## Removing it

On Linux and a Mac:

```sh
sudo sh /usr/local/share/clipboardbridge/uninstall.sh
```

On SteamOS it is `sudo sh /opt/clipboardbridge/share/uninstall.sh`. With Homebrew, run
`brew uninstall clipboardbridge` after it.

On Windows: Settings, Apps, "Clipboard Bridge", Uninstall.

This removes the program, the service and the firewall rules the installer added. The
device's keys stay, so installing again brings it back into its group. To delete them too,
add `--purge` (`-Purge` on Windows, with
`powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:ProgramFiles\clipboardbridge\uninstall.ps1" -Purge`),
then remove the device from the group on another one (`sudo cbb revoke NAME`, or on the
phone).
