# Threat model

For engineers and security reviewers: what Clipboard Bridge protects, from whom, where the
trust boundaries are, and which defence answers each threat, with the code that holds it.
It describes the version in this repository; what is not built yet is marked **open**. The
plan of the security audit is in [security-audit.md](security-audit.md), the wire format in
the [protocol](protocol.md), and how to report a vulnerability in
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).

## Assets

| Asset | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| The clipboard's content | passwords, codes, private texts, images and files |
| Secrets (marked by a password manager or `-secret`) | the most sensitive copies; they must not outlive their minute |
| The group's keys: the root key, the admin CAs' keys | whoever holds them can add devices and so read every copy |
| A device's member key and tunnel key | whoever holds them can act as that device until it is removed |
| Control of a device: remote paste, quick actions, sync modes | an admin can type into a device or restart it |
| The group's metadata: which devices exist, their names, when they talk | tells a server or a network who owns what and when they are active |
| The programs themselves | a changed release could do anything on every device |

## Adversaries

| Adversary | Can | Cannot, by assumption |
|---|---|---|
| **A device on the home network** (a guest, an IoT device) | see and send any packet on the LAN, answer mDNS, run a rogue member | break TLS 1.3 or the signatures |
| **A network on the way** (a café's Wi-Fi, an ISP, a censor) | see, drop and change every packet away from home, block protocols | the same |
| **A server operator** (a forwarder or relay someone else runs, its hosting provider) | see the traffic it passes, keep logs, change or drop packets | read inside the WireGuard tunnel and the member TLS |
| **A thief with a device** | everything on its disk; on a phone, what its lock allows | unlock a phone's hardware keys without the user's face, fingerprint or passcode |
| **A compromised member** | everything that device may do in the group | more than its role allows (a member is not an admin) |
| **A compromised admin** | sign records and commands until it is frozen or removed | act after another admin freezes it; remove the root |
| **A local user** on a shared computer | run programs as themselves | read the service's files, use the admin socket |
| **A supply-chain attacker** | change a dependency, try to change a release | sign a release with the project's keys |

Out of scope: an attacker with root on a device that is in the group, and the systems' own
clipboards, which any program of the signed-in user may read.

## Trust boundaries

1. **The device.** The service runs as its own user; the admin socket admits only the
   computer's administrators, the control socket root and the `clipboardbridge` group. A
   phone's keys are behind its secure hardware and biometrics.
2. **The home network.** Every connection between members is mutual TLS 1.3 under the
   group's certificates, on the member port, which takes only private, unique-local and
   link-local addresses (and on routers only the home zones' interfaces).
3. **The internet.** Away from home, members reach the group only through its WireGuard
   tunnel to a hub; the member TLS runs inside it. A forwarder or a blind relay sits on this
   boundary and holds no keys of the group.
4. **The release.** Programs come from this repository's CI, with checksums and build
   provenance, and are signed with the project's own keys outside CI.

## Threats and defences

STRIDE: **S**poofing, **T**ampering, **R**epudiation, **I**nformation disclosure, **D**enial
of service, **E**levation of privilege.

| # | Boundary | STRIDE | Threat | Defence | Where |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | home network | I | someone on the LAN reads the traffic | TLS 1.3 on every connection; no plain-text protocol | `internal/node`, `lite/core/src/tls` |
| 2 | home network | S | a device poses as a member, for example by answering mDNS or `clipboardbridge.local` | mutual TLS: members dial discovered addresses and check the peer's certificate against the group's CAs, the device records and the revocations | `internal/group`, `internal/node` |
| 3 | home network | S | someone guesses or intercepts a pairing code | CPace inside TLS, bound to the TLS exporter: one online guess per attempt, three per window of 5 minutes, no offline attack; the code never on the command line | `internal/pair`, `lite/core/src/pair` |
| 4 | home network | S | a man in the middle during a phone's QR pairing | the QR code carries the pairing code, which the phone spends on CPace inside TLS as in threat 3, so a device in the middle learns nothing it can use | the kits' `Pairing*` |
| 5 | home network | D | a flood of connections or mDNS packets | limits on handshakes, mDNS cache entries and peers; the member port drops other addresses | `internal/service`, `internal/mdns` |
| 6 | internet | I, T | someone on the way reads or changes the traffic away from home | the member TLS inside the group's WireGuard tunnel, a preshared key per client, chunk frames padded to 16 KiB; **open**: padding text frames and cover traffic | `internal/tunnel` |
| 7 | internet | S, D | packets to the hub's port from outside the group | WireGuard drops every packet without a key that a member offered in its authenticated hello, or an invitation's guest key | `internal/tunnel` |
| 8 | internet | I | a censor detects and blocks the tunnel | AmneziaWG's obfuscation, VLESS with REALITY in front of the forwarder | `internal/tunnel`, `internal/vless` |
| 9 | internet | I | a forwarder or relay learns who the devices are | short server credentials per period instead of the group's records: no device ID, name, system or role (D-67, D-75); the forwarder routes by `mac1` and keeps no group files | `internal/forward`, `internal/relay`, `internal/group/credential.go` |
| 10 | internet | I | a relay learns who talks to whom and when | **accepted, told to the user**: the relay sees which devices are online, from where, and how much they send; `cbb global relay` and the apps say so and ask before it is used | `cmd/cbb/global.go` |
| 11 | internet | D | a group, or a few hosts, fill a shared server | limits per group, per address and per network on the forwarder and an open relay | `internal/forward`, `internal/relay/limits.go` |
| 12 | device | I | a thief copies the keys from a disk | keys in hardware where the device has it (phones, Linux with a TPM), the files readable only by the service; **open**: the Secure Enclave on Macs and the TPM on Windows | `internal/tpmkey`, `internal/group/keys.go` |
| 13 | device | E | a thief uses a phone's root or admin key | the key signs only after the user's face, fingerprint or passcode | the kits' `SecKeySigner`, Keystore |
| 14 | group | S | a removed device keeps acting | revocation records reach every member, which then refuse its certificate; the hub drops its tunnel key | `internal/group/records.go` |
| 15 | group | E | a stolen admin computer signs records | any admin freezes it (nothing it signs counts from then on); only the root or an admin phone removes an admin; file-key admins need the user's explicit consent (key levels) | `internal/group`, `cmd/cbb/devices.go` |
| 16 | group | E | the root is lost | an admin takes the group over with signed `root` records; the devices stay | `internal/group`, `PhoneGroup.takeOver` |
| 17 | group | T | a device moves the group's clocks for good | received times more than 7 days ahead are refused | `internal/hlc` |
| 18 | group | T, R | a replayed or forged command (paste, action, mode) | commands are signed by an admin, expire 30 s after signing, are checked against the revocations and a replay cache, and each device logs who sent what | `internal/group/command.go`, `internal/remotepaste`, `internal/actions` |
| 19 | device control | E | an admin types into a device or restarts it against its user's will | every remote paste target and quick action is off until the device's own user turns it on there; Enter, the console and reboot are separate consents; any admin turns them off everywhere; never on a lock or login screen | `internal/remotepaste`, `internal/actions`, `internal/lockcheck` |
| 20 | device control | E | a pasted text runs as a command | control characters removed; a text with a line break goes to a terminal or the console only with the user's Enter switch | `internal/remotepaste` |
| 21 | device control | E | a user's own action becomes a shell | the program runs by its full path with fixed arguments, no shell, as the signed-in user, for at most 15 s | `internal/actions` |
| 22 | device | I | another local user reads the clipboard through the service | the control socket admits only root and the `clipboardbridge` group; changes to the group only on the admin socket | `internal/control`, `internal/service/control_windows.go` |
| 23 | device | E | a bug in the network code takes over the computer | memory-safe languages; the service unprivileged in a systemd sandbox (`NoNewPrivileges`, `ProtectSystem=strict`, no capabilities, restricted address families and system calls) | `packaging/linux/clipboardbridge.service` |
| 24 | device | I | a secret outlives its minute | secrets are kept in memory only, never on disk, and gone 60 s after the copy; their formatting is never read | `internal/clip` |
| 25 | device | E | a received file is opened as a program | received files are never executable, carry the quarantine mark on a Mac and the Mark of the Web on Windows, and names are made safe | `internal/mediafile` |
| 26 | iPhone shortcut | I | a member uses the iPhone CA against the phone's other HTTPS | the iPhone CA is limited by name constraints to `clipboardbridge.local` and excludes IP addresses | `internal/group/cert.go` |
| 27 | release | T | a changed program reaches users | release builds only in CI, pinned actions, `SHA256SUMS`, build provenance attestations; release files signed outside CI with the project's keys: roots on two YubiKeys, the release key in a Mac's Secure Enclave, a channel key on cbb.tools that only renews `stable.json` (D-69); every installer and updater checks them against the pinned roots | `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `internal/release`, `packaging/get.sh`, `tools/release-sign` |
| 28 | release | T | a vulnerable dependency | few dependencies, `govulncheck` for Go and OSV-Scanner for the Rust crates, the Android libraries and the tray app in CI | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |

## Residual risks

- A member reads the group's clipboard by design: anyone who controls a device of the group
  reads every copy that reaches it. Keep the group to devices you control.
- Keys in a file (Macs, Windows PCs, Linux computers without a TPM, the lite member) can be
  copied by whoever reads the disk; encrypt the disk and remove a lost device at once.
- A blind relay and the project's forwarder see addresses and times of activity (threat 10).
- The systems' clipboards are readable by any program of the signed-in user; Clipboard
  Bridge cannot protect a copy from other programs on the same device.
- What has not run on real devices yet is listed in the [README](../README.md#status); the
  hardware key paths in particular are tested against simulators only.
