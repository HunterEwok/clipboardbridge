# The product's functions, for the bench

Every function of Clipboard Bridge as release 0.6 has it, one line each, with the cases of
[testbench-catalogue.md](testbench-catalogue.md) that check it. It is gathered from
[design.md](design.md), [protocol.md](protocol.md), [apps.md](apps.md),
[reference/cli.md](reference/cli.md) and the 0.6 plan. "A function" is something a user can
do or rely on, or a rule of the protocol that a device on the bench can break on purpose and
watch being kept.

`testbench coverage` reads this table: a function counts as covered when one of its cases
is in the catalogue, as automatic when one of those runs without a person, and as run when
the harness runs one today. A function with no case says so with `-`, and is listed. Add a
line here with every new function, and a case for it in the catalogue.
