## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository scaffolding: license (AGPL-3.0-only), security policy, contributing rules,
  code of conduct, issue forms and repository settings.
- Design document: [docs/design.md](docs/design.md).
- The `clipbridge` command: `service` runs the service; `pair` and `join` admit a computer to
  the group with a six-digit code; `copy` and `paste` use the group's clipboard; `status`
  shows the group and the connected members.
- The service: the group's certificates, pairing, mDNS discovery (publishing on Linux,
  browsing on a Mac), member connections and the sync engine, and a local control socket.
- The connector package, which links a desktop clipboard to the service.
- CI: formatting, vet, staticcheck, govulncheck, actionlint and repository rules; tests on Linux and
  macOS; builds for Linux (x86-64, ARM64, ARMv7, ARMv6) and macOS (ARM64, x86-64).
