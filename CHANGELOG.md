## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository scaffolding: license (AGPL-3.0-only), security policy, contributing rules,
  code of conduct, issue forms and repository settings.
- Design document: [docs/design.md](docs/design.md).
- The `clipbridge` command: `service` runs the service; `pair` and `join` admit a computer to
  the group with a six-digit code; `copy` and `paste` use the group's clipboard; `status`
  shows the group and the connected members.
- The service: the group's certificates, pairing, mDNS discovery (publishing on Linux,
  browsing on a Mac), member connections and the sync engine, and a local control socket.
- The connector package, which links a desktop clipboard to the service.
- Linux desktops: `clipbridge desktop` links the session's clipboard, through Wayland
  data-control or X11 (XWayland on GNOME), started by an XDG autostart entry.
- Linux packaging: a hardened systemd unit, the service user, a tmux configuration, an
  optional tmux start on the text console, and `packaging/linux/install.sh`.
- macOS: `clipbridge agent` links the pasteboard (secrets stay on the Mac and carry the
  concealed marker); the service runs as a LaunchDaemon and the agent as a LaunchAgent,
  installed by `packaging/macos/install.sh`.
- iPhone: `clipbridge pair -phone` on the member that holds `clipbridge.local` serves the
  profile with the iPhone CA and a pairing page that issues the shortcut's token; the
  shortcut's `/sync` sends the iPhone's text to the group or brings a recent copy back.
  `pair -phone` shows a QR code of a page that walks through the steps; the shortcut,
  generated from the code and signed on a Mac, asks for the six-digit code on its first run
  and keeps its token.
- The phone as the main device: `clipbridge pair -phone` on a Linux machine in no group
  creates the group, and `clipbridge join` shows a QR code (a `clipbridge://join` URL) that
  the shortcut "clipbridge: add a computer" scans to admit the computer. `clipbridge join
  -code` keeps the code from `clipbridge pair`.
- Protocol specification: [docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md); the plan for the phone apps:
  [docs/apps.md](docs/apps.md).
- CI: formatting, vet, staticcheck, govulncheck, actionlint and repository rules; tests on Linux and
  macOS; builds for Linux (x86-64, ARM64, ARMv7, ARMv6) and macOS (ARM64, x86-64).
