// keysWarning is what a user agrees to before a device whose keys sit in
// files syncs away from home (docs/design.md, "Turning it on, step by
// step").
const keysWarning = `Sync away from home lets this device reach the group's hub from the internet,
through the group's own WireGuard tunnel, with the clipboard encrypted end to end.

This device keeps its keys in files, not in a security chip. Whoever copies those
files (with root on this device, from its disk or memory card, or from an
unencrypted backup) can act as this device from anywhere until you remove it from
the group. To keep that from happening:

  - encrypt the disk (LUKS, BitLocker, FileVault);
  - keep the service's state directory out of unencrypted backups;
  - remove the device at once (cbb revoke, or Remove on the phone) when it is lost
    or someone else may have had root on it.

`

// relayNotice says what a blind relay learns, before the user agrees to
// meet there (docs/design.md, "Blind relay").
const relayNotice = `A blind relay is a meeting point for the devices of a group that has no hub of its own.
The clipboard stays encrypted end to end between the devices: the relay cannot read it
or pose as a device. It does learn, while the devices use it:

  - which devices of the group are online, and their internet addresses;
  - which of them talk to each other, when, and how much they send.

A hub of the group's own lets none of this out. Use a relay you run yourself, or one
whose operator you trust with this; the project's relay keeps none of it in logs.
