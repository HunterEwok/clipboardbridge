const usage = `Usage: clipboardbridge <command> [arguments]

Commands:
  copy [-secret]          Send standard input to the group.
  copy [-text TEXT] FILE...
                          Send files and folders to the group; -type png|jpeg|html FILE
                          sends one image or HTML as clipboard data.
  paste [-terminal [-lines] [-secret]]
                          Print this member's clipboard text; -terminal makes it
                          safe to paste into a terminal.
  paste -o DIR            Save the clipboard's images or files in the folder DIR.
  paste -on DEVICE [-type] [-enter] [-secret]
                          On an admin: put standard input, or this clipboard, where the
                          focus is on another device that allows remote paste.
  paste-receive [on [-enter] [-console] | off]
                          Show, or turn on or off, remote paste on this device;
                          off -on DEVICE or off -all on an admin turns it off elsewhere.
  keyboard [on [-layout us|ru] [-rate N] [-pastes] | off | pair | type [TEXT]]
                          Make this Linux computer a Bluetooth keyboard for a TV, a tablet
                          or a computer near it: pair shows it to a new one for two minutes,
                          type types TEXT or standard input there.
  remote [add [-roku -consent] [-name NAME] ADDRESS | code CODE | cancel | remove TV
         | pastes TV on|off | type [-tv TV] [TEXT]]
                          Be the remote of a TV on the home network: an Android TV or a
                          Google TV pairs with the code it shows, a Roku over plain HTTP;
                          type types TEXT or standard input in its open text field.
  action [enable NAME [-by KINDS] [-any-key] | disable NAME | off]
                          Show this device's quick actions (lock, sleep, reboot, shutdown,
                          cancel-shutdown, restart), or turn one on or off here.
  action -on DEVICE NAME  On an admin: run the quick action NAME on another device;
                          action off -on DEVICE or -all turns them off elsewhere.
  status                  Show this device, its group and the group's devices.
  revoke <name or ID>     Remove a device from the group.
  rename <name or ID> <new name>
                          Give a device of the group another name (on an admin).
  admin <name or ID>      Make a computer an admin of the group (on the group's root).
  takeover <name or ID>   Take the group over from its lost root computer (on an admin).
  upgrade                 Give a group made before 0.4 a root: this computer (holds its keys).
  freeze <name or ID>     Stop an admin computer, as a stolen one, until the root decides.
  unfreeze <name or ID>   Make a frozen admin computer an admin again (on the group's root).
  global [on|off]         Show, or turn on or off, sync over the internet on this device.
  global hub address:port Make this device the group's hub for sync over the internet.
  global relay address:port
                          Meet the group's other devices over the internet at a relay.
  forward                 Run a forwarder for hubs that clients cannot reach directly.
  relay -group TAG        Run a blind relay for groups without a hub.
  new                     Create a group with this computer as its root.
  mode [own|shared|receive|send]
                          Show or set what moves between this clipboard and the group;
                          a new device keeps its own.
  mode -on DEVICE MODE    On an admin: set the sync mode of another device of the group.
  config [max-copy|max-copy-away SIZE]
                          Show or set the largest copy of images and files this device
                          sends or fetches, at home (100MiB) and away from home (25MiB).
  pair                    In a group: show a code for a new computer. In none: join one,
                          by the phone's QR code or the code from cbb pair on the group.
  pair -code [address]    Join with the code from cbb pair on the root or an admin.
  pair -phone             Pair an iPhone or iPad with the shortcut.
  pair -invite file       Join from afar with an invitation from cbb invite.
  invite [-for 1h]        Invite a device from afar: run on the group's hub.
  update [-check | -to VERSION]
                          Install the newest signed release, as root or administrator;
                          -check only says whether there is one.
  update -auto [on|off]   Show, or turn on or off, updating once a day by itself.
  version                 Print the version and the platform.
  help                    Print this help.

Rarely needed:
  holder [auto|first|fallback|never]
                          Show or set whether this computer holds clipboardbridge.local.
  network                 Take the network this computer is on now as one where the group
                          is: it publishes itself and takes connections only on those.
  install [options]       Windows, after winget: install the service from this copy
                          (the options of install.ps1, such as -Express).
  service                 Run the service (started by systemd, launchd or Windows).
  agent                   Link this desktop's clipboard to the service (started at sign-in).
  paste-helper tmux|console|uinput
                          Take remote pastes into tmux (started by clipboardbridge.conf)
                          or the Linux text console (the clipboardbridge-console unit).
