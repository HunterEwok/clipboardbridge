//! The protocol core of the clipboardbridge lite member (docs/protocol.md):
//! certificates and their checks, the signed records, the hybrid clock, the
//! sync engine, the frames of the member protocol and the joiner's side of
//! the pairing, and the format of the saved state for a board without a file
//! system. It does no I/O and needs no operating system, only an
//! allocator and a source of randomness, so the same code runs in the lite
//! member on Linux and on a microcontroller such as the ESP32.
//!
//! With the tls feature it has the members' TLS as well (rustls without
//! the standard library, a RustCrypto provider and a session without I/O).
//!
//! Randomness comes from the getrandom crate: on Linux from the kernel, on a
//! microcontroller from the function the firmware registers as getrandom's
//! custom backend. Without the std feature the locks are spin locks.

// The core reads what peers send and runs inside the phones' apps and the
// Go service, so a panic there is a crash or a hang. It has no unsafe code,
// and outside its tests nothing may panic: no unwrap or expect, no indexing
// that can fail and no arithmetic that can overflow. The few places that
// cannot fail say why where they allow it.
