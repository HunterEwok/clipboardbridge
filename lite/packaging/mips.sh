# Builds the lite member for 32-bit MIPS routers, without the tunnel:
#
#   sh lite/packaging/mips.sh mips|mipsel
#
# mips-unknown-linux-musl (big-endian) and mipsel-unknown-linux-musl are
# Tier 3 in Rust, so the standard library is built from source on nightly
# Rust, and zig links the static musl binary (cargo-zigbuild); both soft
# float, as OpenWrt's MIPS targets. GotaTun needs 64-bit atomics, which
# 32-bit MIPS lacks, so the build leaves out sync away from home (the
# feature tunnel; docs/roadmap.md, item 37). The binary is not
# position-independent: a static PIE crashed at its start under
# qemu-mips. It lands in lite/target/<target>/release/cbb.
