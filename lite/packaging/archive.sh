# Packs a built lite member into its release archive:
#
#   sh lite/packaging/archive.sh path/to/cbb TARGET NAME OUTDIR
#
# writes OUTDIR/clipboardbridge-lite-linux-<NAME>.tar.gz, which holds
# clipboardbridge-lite/ with the binary cbb, LICENSE, README.md,
# THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES (the licenses of the crates for TARGET; see notices.sh)
# and packaging/ laid out as in the full member's Linux archive: the same
# install.sh, uninstall.sh and firewall.sh, the tmux configuration, the
# console helper's unit, the lite member's own systemd unit and OpenWrt's
# installer (its init script runs cbb run for the lite member), so that
# get.sh --lite and a manual install work as for a full member. The release
# workflow and CI both use it.
