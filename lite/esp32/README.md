# The lite member on the Arduino Nano ESP32

Firmware for the [Arduino Nano ESP32](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-esp32/) (an
ESP32-S3), written in Rust on the same protocol core as the lite member on Linux (`lite/core`), with
the member TLS 1.3 on the chip itself (docs/roadmap.md, item 15).

So far the board keeps its settings in flash, joins the Wi-Fi network set on its console
and takes an address by DHCP, joins a group by the phone, and runs a self-test of the
protocol core: it makes two keys
and self-signed certificates with the chip's true random number generator (fed by the
ADC's noise), runs a pairing TLS 1.3 handshake between them in memory, passes a message
and checks that both ends export the same key. Its USB port can be a keyboard that types a
text on the computer, TV or console it is plugged into (see "The USB keyboard" below), and
the board can be a Bluetooth LE keyboard for a TV, tablet or computer nearby (see "The
Bluetooth keyboard").
Syncing (which needs the time of day, from SNTP) comes next, and with it remote paste
through the keyboard. It is not yet run on a real board.

## Build and flash

The ESP32-S3 is an Xtensa chip, which needs Espressif's Rust toolchain:
[espup](https://github.com/esp-rs/espup) installs it as `esp`, or take the 1.99.0.0
release of [esp-rs/rust-build](https://github.com/esp-rs/rust-build) as CI does. The
firmware links with `rust-lld`, so no GCC is needed.

```sh
cd lite/esp32
cargo +esp run --release
```

`cargo run` builds and hands the firmware to
[espflash](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash), which writes it with the partition table
`partitions.csv` over the board's USB-C port and then opens the console. Without cargo:

```sh
espflash flash --monitor --chip esp32s3 --partition-table partitions.csv \
  target/xtensa-esp32s3-none-elf/release/cbb-esp32
```

The partition table matters: the settings live in its partition `cbb`. A board flashed
without it says so on the console and keeps the Wi-Fi network only until it restarts.

esp-hal and its crates come from a fixed commit of their git repository. Rust 1.99 no
longer keeps the order of `global_asm!` blocks, which breaks esp-hal 1.2.2's start-up code
for the S3 (it does not link). The fix (esp-hal #6497) is in that commit but not yet in a
release. Move back to crates.io once a release carries it.

## The console

The board's USB port is a serial port; type on it in espflash's monitor (`espflash
monitor`) or any serial terminal. The board echoes what is typed and shows stars for a
password.

```text
cbb> wifi
Wi-Fi network name: Home
Password (empty for an open network): ********
Saved. Joining Home.
cbb-esp32: joined Home
cbb-esp32: address 192.168.0.57/24
cbb> status
  firmware: cbb-esp32 0.1.0
  Wi-Fi network: Home
  network: joined Home, address 192.168.0.57/24
  error details: off
```

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | what the board knows and how its network is doing |
| `wifi` | sets the Wi-Fi network to join: asks for its name and password, saves them and joins it |
| `wifi forget` | leaves the Wi-Fi network and forgets it |
| `join [NAME]` | joins a group by the phone, under NAME (default: Nano ESP32): see below |
| `leave` | forgets the group; remove the board in the app too, so the group revokes it |
| `debug on`, `debug off` | shows the details of errors under their message, or not; saved in flash. Without it a debug build shows them and a release build does not |
| `selftest` | runs the TLS 1.3 self-test |
| `usb keyboard`, `usb console` | makes the USB port a keyboard with the console beside it, or the console again; saved, and the board restarts |
| `layout [us\|ru]` | the layout active on the host the keyboard types on (default `us`); saved |
| `rate [N]` | how many characters a second the keyboard types, 5 to 60 (default 20); saved |
| `ble on`, `ble off` | makes the board a Bluetooth LE keyboard, or not; saved, and the board restarts |
| `ble pair` | makes the Bluetooth keyboard discoverable for two minutes, for a host to pair with it |
| `ble forget` | forgets every host the Bluetooth keyboard is paired with; the board restarts |
| `type TEXT` | types TEXT on a connected Bluetooth host, or else on the USB keyboard |
| `flash` | restarts into the ROM's download mode, for espflash |

The board joins WPA2 networks (and WPA2/WPA3 mixed ones), or open ones with an empty password; it joins
again after the connection drops.

## Joining a group

Once the board has an address, type `join`. It prints a `clipboardbridge://join?...` link
with a new pairing code, its address and port 8764 and the fingerprint of its pairing
certificate; in the app, tap "Connect a new device" and paste it. The phone dials the
board, and the two run the pairing of docs/protocol.md over TLS 1.3 (`lite/embassy`, the
same exchange as the lite member's `cbb join`, with the core's `Joiner`). The phone proves the code
first; three wrong codes, or five minutes without a phone, end the attempt. The board
takes connections from private addresses only. It saves the identity the phone's Welcome
gives it, as a lite member without CA keys, and `status` shows the group.

The board announces itself as a Linux lite member: the pairing knows only Linux and macOS
as systems so far. A QR code drawn on the console, so the phone can scan the terminal, may
follow.

## The USB keyboard

`usb keyboard` makes the board's USB port a USB device of two functions on the chip's OTG
controller: a boot keyboard (it works in a BIOS, a UEFI setup, a disk-encryption prompt
and on TVs and consoles that take a USB keyboard) and a serial port (CDC-ACM) for the
console. The Nano ESP32's USB-C port has the chip's only USB PHY, so the USB serial of the
console mode (with espflash's automatic reset) is gone in keyboard mode: open the new
serial port in any terminal for the console, and type `flash` there before flashing.
If the console is unreachable, short B1 to GND while pressing reset: the board then starts
in download mode. A panic's message still goes to the USB serial, so in keyboard mode it is
lost.

`type TEXT` types TEXT with the board's `layout`, which must be the layout active on the
host: a keyboard sends the position of a key, and the host's layout makes it a character.
`us` types every printable ASCII character; `ru` the Russian letters, the digits and the
punctuation of the Russian layout. A text with a character the layout has no key for is
refused, and the board names those characters; it never types something else in their
place. A new line presses Enter and a tab presses Tab. Each character is a key down and then
every key up, `rate` characters a second, since some TVs drop keys that come faster. The
tables live in the protocol core (`cbb_core::keyboard`), for the phones' keyboards too.

The USB IDs are Espressif's vendor ID with the product ID its TinyUSB stack gives a device of
a serial port and a HID function (303a:4005).

## The Bluetooth keyboard

`ble on` makes the board a Bluetooth LE keyboard: HID over GATT (HOGP), with
[trouble-host](https://github.com/embassy-rs/trouble) on esp-radio's controller, which
shares the one radio with Wi-Fi. The ESP32-S3 has no classic Bluetooth, so the host must take
BLE keyboards: Android and Google TV, Fire TV, Apple TV, iPads and phones, Samsung and LG
TVs, Windows, macOS and Linux do. It types with the same `layout` and `rate` as the USB
keyboard, and the GATT services carry the same boot keyboard's report map, with the boot
protocol's reports for a host that asks for them.

`ble pair` makes the keyboard discoverable for two minutes: pair "CBB Nano ESP32" from the
host's Bluetooth settings then. The board has no display for a code, so the pairing is Just
Works (LE Secure Connections where the host has it), as with any keyboard without one. The
rest of the time the board advertises without the discoverable flag, so the hosts it is
paired with connect again by themselves and no other device lists it; a host that pairs
outside the two minutes is dropped, and the board types only on a host it is paired with,
over an encrypted link. It keeps up to four hosts in its settings (a fifth pushes out the
oldest), under a static random address made from its Bluetooth MAC address, so the hosts
know it after a restart. `ble forget` forgets them all; forget the board on the hosts too.

While a paired host is connected, `type` types there; otherwise on the USB keyboard, if the
USB port is one.

## Settings in flash

The partition `cbb` (64 KB) holds two slots. A save goes to the slot that does not hold the
newest copy, and each copy ends with its SHA-256, so a power cut while saving keeps the
last good copy (`cbb_core::store`, with its tests on the host).

The flash is not encrypted: whoever holds the board can read the Wi-Fi password and the
member's key from it. The ESP32-S3 could encrypt its flash, but that burns eFuses for
good, so it is not done yet. Removing the board from the group revokes its certificate,
as for any lost device.

## Test in QEMU

```sh
QEMU=path/to/qemu-system-xtensa ESPFLASH=path/to/espflash ./qemu-test.sh
```

The script builds with the `qemu` feature, writes a flash image with the partition table,
and `qemu-test.py` boots it in [Espressif's QEMU](https://github.com/espressif/qemu)
(machine `esp32s3`) three times, typing on the console over UART0: it checks that `join`
says the build has no network, sets a Wi-Fi network and debug mode, runs the self-test, sets the keyboard's layout and rate, checks that `type` refuses what the layout cannot type and that the build has no keyboard and no Bluetooth, checks that all of it is still there after a restart,
forgets the network and checks that it stays forgotten.

That build has no Wi-Fi (QEMU does not emulate the S3's radio) and skips esp-hal's init,
because QEMU does not emulate the clock calibration it waits for; without init the chip's
generator does not work, so it uses a fixed pseudo-random sequence instead: its keys are
not secret, and it says so when it starts. Never flash the `qemu` build to a board.

## Test the network code on Linux

The pairing lives in the crate [`lite/embassy`](../embassy), on embassy-net and nothing of
the chip. Its feature `host` builds `esp32-on-linux`, which runs the same code on Linux:
embassy-net over a TAP interface with a fixed address takes the place of the Wi-Fi and
DHCP, and `esp32-on-linux` joins a group by the phone as the board's `join` does. The Go test
`TestEmbassyJoiner` plays the phone and has a Go member admit it (CONTRIBUTING.md, "The
other parts", has the commands; CI's `lite` job runs it). Only the Wi-Fi driver and the
flash stay for a real board.
