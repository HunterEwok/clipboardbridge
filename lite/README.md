# The lite member

The lite member is a small Clipboard Bridge member in Rust for weak Linux devices: a
Raspberry Pi, a router, a small board. Its command is `cbb`, as on a full member, with the
same paths and service (`cbb version` says which one a device runs). It speaks the member
protocol of [docs/protocol.md](../docs/protocol.md), but unlike a full member it

- never holds CA keys, so it never admits devices;
- dials the computers on the home network (found by mDNS, or named with `-peer`), and
  publishes itself in mDNS
  and listens on the member port, TCP 8764, so that phones and other lite members
  dial it: a phone syncs with it directly, with no computer on;
- never holds `clipboardbridge.local` or serves the shortcut, the Apple Shortcuts action an
  iPhone without the app uses (a phone with the app, iPhone or Android, needs neither);
- has no desktop clipboard of its own: other programs use `copy`, `paste` and `watch`.

Full members list it with role `lite`. Away from home, or on another subnet where mDNS does
not reach, it syncs through the group's WireGuard tunnel to the hub once `cbb global on` is
run on it ("Sync away from home" below); it dials no address outside the home network
itself.

The protocol core is its own crate, [`core`](core) (`cbb_core`): certificates, records,
the hybrid clock, the sync engine, the frames and the joiner's side of the pairing, with
CPace in `core/src/third_party/cpace`. It does no I/O and needs no operating system
(no_std with alloc; RustCrypto for P-256, SHA-2 and HMAC), so a lite member on the ESP32
can use it as it is. On a microcontroller the firmware supplies the randomness, as
getrandom's custom backend (`__getrandom_v03_custom`), and the core's locks are spin
locks; with the `std` feature, as the lite member uses it, they are the standard library's.

With the `tls` feature the core has the TLS of members and pairing too (`core/src/tls`):
rustls through its unbuffered API, which needs no standard library, with a crypto
provider of RustCrypto code (TLS 1.3 only, ChaCha20-Poly1305 or AES-128-GCM, X25519,
ECDSA P-256), the certificate checks, a `Session` that does no I/O (the caller moves the
bytes) and the pairing's TLS exporter, which rustls offers only with std: the core takes
the exporter secret from the connection's key log and derives the exporter itself
(RFC 8446, section 7.5). The lite member runs on exactly this code, so the e2e test below
checks the TLS a microcontroller would use against Go members.
The lite member itself (`src`) adds the state files, the sockets, mDNS, the control socket,
the service and the tunnel to the hub (`src/tunnel.rs`, `src/away.rs`): GotaTun's WireGuard
from Mullvad and smoltcp's TCP, in one thread, behind a port on the loopback address that the
member TLS dials. GotaTun gets its ChaCha20-Poly1305 from a stand-in for ring on RustCrypto
([`ring-shim`](ring-shim), patched in by `Cargo.toml`), so the build stays all Rust.

## Build

With Rust 1.85 or later:

```sh
cd lite
cargo build --release          # target/release/cbb
cargo test --workspace         # unit tests and the vectors in ../testdata/interop
```

The core alone, with its TLS, for a RISC-V microcontroller such as the ESP32-C6
(`rustup target add riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf`; `.cargo/config.toml` sets getrandom's
backend):

```sh
cargo build -p clipboardbridge-core --features tls --release --target riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf
```

For the ESP32-S3 (Xtensa) with Espressif's Rust toolchain (`espup install`, or the
`esp32` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, which fetches the same toolchain directly):

```sh
cargo +esp build -Zbuild-std=core,alloc -p clipboardbridge-core --features tls --release \
  --target xtensa-esp32s3-none-elf
```

For a Raspberry Pi (64-bit Raspberry Pi OS or Debian) from an x86 Linux machine:

```sh
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
sudo apt install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_LINKER=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc \
  cargo build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

For a Raspberry Pi Zero, Zero W or Pi 1 (ARMv6, 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS): a static binary,
all Rust, with no cross toolchain (`.cargo/config.toml` holds the settings):

```sh
rustup target add arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf
cargo build --release --target arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf
```

CI builds both for every pull request: the `clipboardbridge-lite-linux-arm64` and
`clipboardbridge-lite-linux-armv6` artifacts of the `lite member (Rust)` job. A release builds static musl binaries for x86-64,
ARM64 and ARMv6 with Rust's own linker (`.cargo/config.toml`), each in an archive
(`packaging/archive.sh`) with `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES`, the licenses of the crates it is built
from (`packaging/notices.sh`), and the installer of the full member's Linux archive with the
lite member's own systemd unit (`packaging/clipboardbridge.service`).

The e2e test runs the lite member among Go members: it joins through the phone's QR code,
gets no CA keys and syncs both ways.

```sh
cd .. && CBB_LITE=$PWD/lite/target/release/cbb go test ./internal/service -run TestLiteMember -v
```

## Install

On the device, with systemd (Raspberry Pi OS, Debian, Ubuntu):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/HunterEwok/clipboardbridge/releases/latest/download/get.sh | sudo sh -s -- --lite
```

`get.sh --lite` takes the release's static build for this architecture
(`clipboardbridge-lite-linux-amd64.tar.gz`, `-arm64`, or `-armv6`, which also runs on
ARMv7; releases before 0.5 called it `cbb-lite-linux-*`), checks it against `SHA256SUMS` and runs its `packaging/linux/install.sh`, the same installer as a full
member's: the program as `/usr/local/bin/cbb`, the `clipboardbridge` user and group, the
service `clipboardbridge.service`, the tmux configuration, and, with your consent, mDNS and
the member port from the home network in the firewall. `--port N`, `--console`, `--express`
and `--no-firewall` work as for a full member ([the command reference](../docs/reference/cli.md#installers)).
Running it again updates. It refuses to replace a full member, whose keys the lite member
cannot use, and moves an install from before the rename (`cbb-lite`, its own user and
paths) to the new names, keeping the device in its group. Without curl, or for a binary you
built, unpack the archive (or make one with `sh packaging/archive.sh`) and run
`sudo sh clipboardbridge-lite/packaging/linux/install.sh clipboardbridge-lite/cbb`. To remove it:
`sudo sh /usr/local/share/clipboardbridge/uninstall.sh` (`--purge` also deletes the keys).

The service waits until the device joins a group. Join as the service's user, so that it
can read its keys:

```sh
sudo -u clipboardbridge cbb join -name pi
```

It shows a QR code: in the Clipboard Bridge app (iPhone or Android) tap "Connect a new device"
(or, on an iPhone with the shortcut, run "clipboardbridge: add a computer") and scan it. The phone reaches the device on
TCP port 8764 (`-port` to change it), while it joins and afterwards to sync. In a group
without a phone, run `cbb pair` on the group's root or an admin and
`sudo -u clipboardbridge cbb join -code <that member>:8764` here, then type the code.

The installer adds the user who ran `sudo` to the `clipboardbridge` group, for the control
socket without `sudo`:

```sh
echo hello | cbb copy          # -secret for a password: the group keeps it 60 s
cbb paste
cbb status                     # this device, the group and its devices
cbb watch                      # one line per text the group sends here
```

Without mDNS on the network, name the full members in a drop-in
(`sudo systemctl edit clipboardbridge`): `ExecStart=` and then
`ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/cbb run -peer 192.168.0.10:8764 -peer ...`. `run -no-listen`
turns the member port off (the device then only dials the computers).

### Sync away from home

```sh
sudo cbb global on             # read the warning, type yes
cbb global                     # the hub, and whether it is reached through the tunnel
sudo cbb global off            # forget the tunnel's keys
```

Turn it on at home: the device then meets the group's hub (a full member made the hub with
`cbb global hub` there) and keeps the hub's offer, its keys and addresses. Whenever the hub is
neither found on the home network nor connected, it dials the hub through the tunnel: plain
WireGuard to the hub's UDP port, with the member TLS inside, so the clipboard stays encrypted
end to end. At home it sends nothing to the hub's outside addresses. A hub that hides its
tunnel (`-obfuscate` or `-vless`, for networks that block WireGuard) is refused, since the lite
member speaks plain WireGuard only, and the device syncs at home only. The keys are in
`/var/lib/clipboardbridge/tunnel.json`, a file, so the warning asks you to protect the disk
or memory card.

### Remote paste

```sh
sudo cbb paste-receive on      # the group's admins may paste into tmux here
sudo cbb paste-receive on -console -enter   # also the text console, and Enter
cbb paste-receive              # how it stands, and whether a target runs
sudo cbb paste-receive off
```

An admin phone's "Paste on it…", or `cbb paste --on` on an admin computer, puts a text where
this device's keyboard focus is, as on a full Linux member: into the tmux pane in use, through
the helper that clipboardbridge's `tmux.conf` starts in each tmux server, or, with
`-console`, into the active text console, through the `clipboardbridge-console` unit that
`--console` installs. The device's own user turns it on, never an admin; a text with a line
break needs `-enter`, since tmux and the console would run it; a locked tmux client or console,
a login prompt or a console without a logged-in user refuse. The last 100 pastes, never their
text, are in `/var/lib/clipboardbridge/pastes.json`.

### Quick actions

```sh
sudo cbb action enable reboot      # admins with keys in hardware may reboot it
sudo cbb action enable cancel-shutdown
sudo cbb action enable restart     # and restart the service
cbb action                         # how each stands
sudo cbb action disable reboot
sudo cbb action off                # all of them
```

An admin phone's "Quick actions", or `cbb action -on DEVICE NAME` on an admin computer, runs
one of them here, as on a full Linux member. The lite member has three presets: `reboot`, a
minute after the admin asks, which `cancel-shutdown` stops, and `restart`, which restarts the
service. Each is off until the device's own user turns it on; `-by root,phone,computer,watch`
limits it to those kinds of admins, and a reboot takes only admins whose keys are in hardware
unless `-any-key`. Turning `reboot` on writes a polkit rule that lets the service's user ask
logind for a reboot and nothing else (`/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/60-clipboardbridge.rules`), so
the device needs polkit (`polkitd`); `shutdown -r +1` runs it. Any admin turns the actions
off from afar. The last 100 are in `/var/lib/clipboardbridge/actions-log.json`.

## ZX Spectrum Next

On the Accelerated ZX Spectrum Next, the lite member runs on the Raspberry Pi wired to the
Next's second UART (docs/roadmap.md, item 14), and the Next's `.cbb` dot command
types `cbb next ...` at NextPi's shell (`SUP>`) on that UART, as NextPi's own tools
do. These commands answer in frames a Z80 reads without a parser:

- Every line ends in CR (13). Every answer ends in one status line: `CBBOK`, or
  `CBBERR <message>` in printable ASCII (with the cause after it in debug mode). Lines that
  start with `CBB#` are notes to skip.
- Texts are in the Spectrum character set: printable ASCII, CR for a new line, the pound
  sign at 0x60 and the copyright sign at 0x7F. Every other character becomes `?` on the way
  to the Next (the backtick too); from the Next, block graphics, UDGs and BASIC tokens
  become `?` and CR LF is one new line. Cyrillic comes later.
- CRC-32 is IEEE 802.3, as zlib and PiTools' `.crc32` compute it, in 8 lowercase hex
  digits.

| Command | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| `cbb next paste [-max bytes]` | `CBB1 <len> <crc32>`, then len bytes of the latest text (cut to bytes), then CR, then the status line. |
| `cbb next copy [-secret] <len> <crc32>` | `CBBGO` once the service answers; the Next then sends exactly len bytes, which the lite member reads with the terminal in raw mode (no echo, no CR to LF; it gives up after 10 s without a byte), checks the CRC-32 and sends to the group, as a secret with `-secret` (as `cbb copy -secret`); then the status line. |
| `cbb next join [-name name] [-port port] [-addr host[:port]]...` | `CBBQ <size>`, then size rows of the QR code for the phone app, each of (size + 3) / 4 hex digits with the leftmost module in the high bit of the first digit and a set bit dark; the Next draws it, the phone scans it, and after the pairing the status line (up to 5 minutes). A join payload makes a code of about 41 modules, which fits the 192 lines of the screen at 4 pixels per module. |

## Errors

Every error has a short message. `-debug` (before the command), `CBB_DEBUG=1`, or a debug
build adds the cause under it; `CBB_DEBUG=0` hides it in a debug build. The service logs
every error with its cause.
