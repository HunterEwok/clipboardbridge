//! The Rust core's one entry point (docs/core-api.md) as a WebAssembly
//! module, for the Go builds that do not link C: Windows, macOS and FreeBSD
//! run it under wazero (internal/core). Built with
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo build --locked --release -p clipboardbridge-wasm --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
//! ```
//!
//! The module exports `cbb_abi`, `cbb_alloc`, `cbb_call` and `cbb_free`,
//! and imports one function, `env.cbb_random`, which fills a buffer with the
//! host's randomness. The host writes a request into memory it got from
//! `cbb_alloc`; `cbb_call` takes that memory and returns the answer's
//! address and length in one u64, and the host gives the answer back with
//! `cbb_free`.

#![cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
// As in the core: nothing may panic; a panic would trap the host's call.
